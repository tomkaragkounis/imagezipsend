# imagezipsend
A cool feature for wordpress that enables the user to upload images after checkout using PHP + jQuery. The images then are being zipped and send to ftp.

The whole git can be integrated to wordpress. It creates a new page template and run the scripts. 
The user can only upload as many photos as he pays and the order id becomes the name of the zip file.
